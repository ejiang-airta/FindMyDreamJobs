Why Browse AI

We believe the next few years of business automation isn't fully autonomous AI–it's agentic workflow automation.

Today, most businesses operate inefficiently without AI, while fully agentic solutions promise the world but deliver unreliable results. The sweet spot is using AI only where it's truly needed, embedded in transparent, traceable workflows–shifting focus from prompt optimization to context (data) engineering, and sharing the right data with AI systems: no more, no less.

We're building that platform–turning any data source (websites and soon, any API or internal data) into a live API and dataset that powers reliable, hybrid workflows where AI handles what algorithms can't, and structured automation and data queries handle the rest.

700,000+ users and 3,000+ paying customers already aggregate data from 100,000+ sites.
50x YoY growth in automations run.
Growing fast with a lean engineering team of 7 senior engineers.
Backed by top-tier investors and industry leaders like Zapier and used by teams at Apple, Amazon, Shopify, HubSpot, and more.

We're looking for a Head of Engineering to join Browse AI and help us scale our engineering team from 7 to 25+.

The challenge

We're scaling our engineering org from 7 → 25+ while accelerating from $2M to $10M+ ARR. Your mandate is to architect that growth–both the platform and the people–while improving our shipping velocity. Beyond execution, you'll be a strategic partner to the CEO/Head of Product–thinking like a co-founder about product direction, business model, and long-term technical bets.

What You'll Own

Strategic partnership – Act as a thought partner to the CEO on company strategy, product vision, and key business decisions–not just engineering execution.
Org design & leadership – Hire, coach, and retain high-performing engineers; grow future EMs/Tech Leads.
Technical strategy – Set the architecture & roadmap for high-accuracy data extraction, AI agent orchestration, and internal + external integrations.
Execution excellence – Ship daily; uphold a pragmatic bar for code quality, reliability, and security.
Process & tooling – Automate where possible (we're heavy AI users), measure everything, and continuously remove friction.
Cross-functional partnership – Work with Product, GTM, and Customer teams to translate user needs into tangible outcomes.

You might thrive here if you

Scaled a SaaS engineering team through $2M → $10M+ ARR (or Seed/Series A → Series A/B) while keeping a builder's mindset.
Love recruiting and developing talent–your past direct reports still ask you for advice and would love to join your team.
Have hands-on experience in software engineering, a university degree in Computer Science or Software Engineering, and a track record of architecting complex systems.
Navigate ambiguity, relish fast cycles, and bias toward action.
Believe AI will reshape how teams build software (we use it heavily – yet I don't think it's enough).
Think like a founder–comfortable weighing technical tradeoffs against business outcomes and contributing to strategic decisions beyond your domain.
Lead with humility–you're confident but not ego-driven, eager to learn from anyone, and quick to admit when you're wrong.
Are deeply ambitious and driven–you set high standards for yourself and your team, and you're energized by the challenge of building something exceptional.

Our tech stack

TypeScript, React, GraphQL, AWS (Lambda, Fargate, Aurora, Redis, …), and modern tooling that lets us share code between frontend and backend, ship fast, and hire and onboard easily.

We’re heavy users of Linear, Cursor, and PostHog.

Why you'll love it

Scope & impact – You'll build the technical foundation and the culture for the next decade with high autonomy.
Speed without red tape – Direct line to the CEO; decisions in minutes & hours, not weeks.
Flexible, remote-first culture – Work where you're most effective. Being able to work at the Vancouver office is a strong bonus, but not required.
Early equity – Own a meaningful slice of a high-growth, cash-efficient company, last valued US$20m in 2023, with opportunities every other year to sell some shares and gain liquidity.

Make the implicit explicit when it comes to strategy, plans, and the ways we work together.

You live and breathe collaboration with product and design to understand the larger business context and frame projects and prioritization around impact to the business and users.

Bonus points if you are familiar with the Product Management philosophies of people like Marty Cagan and Teresa Torres.
You've worked in product engineering roles with meaningful backend experience and understand the technology, tools, and challenges enough to rise to at least a Senior Engineer or an equivalent level. You're endlessly curious about the technologies your team works with and strive to keep your technical knowledge sharp — but you also feel comfortable knowing your greatest impact won't be as a technical contributor.
You understand the value of building a diverse, equitable, and inclusive team and bring that lens to your work as a leader in hiring, team culture, and beyond. We are trying to raise the standards for developer tools, and we know that a diverse, inclusive, equitable team will help us build better products for a larger swath of the industry.
You have demonstrated experience shaping and improving software delivery. We don’t crave process for its own sake — but we know the right process at the right time can help everyone breathe easier, worry less about the small stuff, and deliver great work more efficiently. You understand methodologies like Agile, XP, and Lean, and see their value, but don't believe there's only one right way to get work done.
You are comfortable with the pace and trade offs of a growth stage startup (meaning: know how to take care of yourself and your team, get your work done without working around the clock, prioritize ruthlessly, be able to tolerate a little uncertainty and sometimes wear different hats).

Delivery Coordination: Liaise with delivery teams to support assessment handoff, kickoff planning, and initial tracking—ensuring continuity from strategy to execution.
Stakeholder Management: Serve as the primary point of contact for internal and client stakeholders, facilitating alignment, surfacing risks, and enabling timely decisions.
Workload Prioritization: Manage incoming requests and support triage to prioritize opportunities based on business impact, feasibility, and team capacity.
Team Collaboration: Partner closely with strategy, automation, and technical teams to align on assessment approaches, resource needs, and overall engagement success.

Qualifications

5+ years of experience in project management, consulting, or delivery roles, ideally within a technology, operations, or service environment

Hive",Unspecified,,,"About the job
The Role

Hive is looking for a Head of Engineering to lead the engineering side of our Research and Development (RND) team through its next chapter of scale. Reporting into the CTO and working hand in hand with our VP Product, you’ll play a key role in evolving our team structure, strengthening our technical foundation, and driving delivery across multiple pods. We’re looking for a people-first leader with a proven track record of delivering real value to customers through great products.

Our RND Team

RND at Hive consists of four pods – Product, Reliability/Platform, Integrations/Data, and Ads. Product, design, engineering and management resources are embedded across all of our pods. Our development philosophy is to build minimum viable products and deliver them as quickly as possible to market, then iterate based on real user feedback. Using this approach we’ve built a growing, profitable business - and the scale and complexity of the technical problems we’re solving is large and growing, too.

What You’ll Do:

Grow and develop a high performing team

Lead and support the Engineering Managers and individual contributors across multiple pods. 
Set clear expectations, coach for growth, and build a culture of accountability, autonomy, and continuous learning. 
Champion hiring, onboarding, and leveling frameworks that ensure we’re bringing in and developing top talent. 

Drive Engineering strategy and execution

Partner with the CTO and VP Product to shape and execute on a long-term technology roadmap aligned with our business objectives. 
Design engineering org structures that scale as we grow, while keeping communication tight and priorities aligned. 
Build operational maturity: define and implement the right rituals, tools, and processes to enable delivery at scale. 

Raise the bar on performance and reliability

Own key KPIs across reliability, latency, scalability, and engineering velocity — and drive initiatives to improve them. 
Cultivate a strong engineering quality bar: thoughtful architecture, technical rigor, and a bias for shipping meaningful impact. 
Take pride in how our infrastructure and product perform for customers — and hold the team to those same high standards. 

Be a key player in driving Hive's success:

Collaborate deeply with product-facing teams (the rest of RND) and customer-facing teams (sales, customer success) to ensure engineering is aligned with customer needs and company goals. 
Bring a constructive, systems-thinking lens to cross-functional discussions — always pushing us to move faster and smarter. 
Be a cultural leader: model our values, advocate for our people, and help build a company where great engineers do their best work

Who you are

You’ve led engineering teams for 5+ years and have spent at least a year in a Director (or equivalent) role. You’ve built, scaled, and evolved engineering orgs before — and carry those lessons with you. 
You understand the tension between process and moving fast, and work with your teams to make sure we're operating efficiently and effectively for the scale we're at. 
You communicate with clarity and precision. You collaborate with humility and lead with influence. 
You are a people-first leader. You coach, inspire, and give clear, actionable feedback. 
You have a systematic approach. You understand that strong teams, clear principles, and the right technical architecture all reinforce each other. 
You are a builder of teams, systems, and operating models. You always think a few quarters ahead, and proactively shaping the team we’ll need in the future. 

How you show up

You deliver and build credibility by doing. Your execution is reliable, your judgment is sound, and your standards are high. 
You act with urgency. You care deeply about the team's success and act accordingly. 
You challenge the status quo. You’re always looking for ways to raise the bar and push Hive forward. 
You’re a peer to the leadership team. You surface risks early, solve problems collaboratively, and actively support your fellow leaders. 
Lastly, you know what matters. You manage your time with intention, direct energy where it counts, and focus on outcomes over optics.
